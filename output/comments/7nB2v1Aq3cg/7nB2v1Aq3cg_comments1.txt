Macha! Our leader nailed it! He's fighting like a true lion for our people! He's taken the fight against all the post-poll violent atrocities going on in Andhra Pradesh straight to Delhi, right to the heart of the nation. He's not just talking about it locally, but he's showing all the evidence to the country's leaders. 

After all, this isn't just about YSRCP versus TDP. It's about the welfare and safety of our people. How can we stand by when our own people are being attacked and their lives are at risk? This isn't just politics; it's about human lives and justice. 

And did you see? He's been so transparent with all the evidence, inviting all political parties to come and see for themselves. That's true leadership, da! If they don't condemn this now, what will be left of our democracy? 

And macha, don't even get me started on the false accusations of "politics of vengeance." YSRCP never indulged in such acts in power. The numbers speak for themselves, yaar – more than a thousand assaults, over 300 attempts to murder, and more than 30 murders! Does that sound like a safe state to you? 

Baap re! The budget and the funds are another story. We all know the promises made are just pie in the sky. But our leader isn't fooled, and neither are we. We know that the truth will prevail. 

Let's stand with him and fight for justice, da! Jai YSRCP!

Aiyo! Our YSRCP Chief really going full throttle against post-poll violence in Andhra Pradesh, no? Taking all those troubling photos and videos to Jantar Mantar - what a good idea! His determination is something else, I tell you. 

He's not beating around the bush, simply putting forth the facts as they are. Our Andhra Pradesh is suffering from such terrible incidents, it's not fair, yaar. This Chandra Babu Naidu and his son – really height of recklessness, making red books with names for their vandalism. Just can't believe how they're getting away with such things! 

But our Chief, he's not sitting idle, no. He's written to the Prime Minister, Home Minister, and even the President, asking them to take note of these atrocities. His commitment to democracy and justice is truly commendable. If we don't condemn such actions, tomorrow what will happen to our state, our country? 

Those people saying YSRCP also indulged in such tactics - absolute nonsense! Our party has never stooped to such levels. Over a thousand assaults, 300 attempts to murder, and 30 murders – this isn't about politics, it's about human lives. 

And talking about budgets and financial support, what use is it when the state is in such a mess? Chandra Babu Naidu's false promises are just adding fuel to the fire. 

But in our YSRCP Chief, we trust. He is doing his best to fight the good fight, and I believe he'll bring justice. Let's support him, and together we can bring a change, machas!

Ayyo! What's going on, ra? You can't believe what's happening in our Andhra Pradesh. Our YSRCP leader is doing a splendid job. He's even taking the fight to the national capital, which is a top thing, man.

He's out there at Jantar Mantar, showing everyone the reality of the post-poll violence. Our man is saying it just how it is. He's not sugarcoating anything, and I really appreciate that. Serious business is met with serious action, you know. We are talking about our people's lives here. 

And what about this plotting against the YSRCP? It's a real shame, ra. But our leader isn't backing down. He's written to the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and even the President of our country. Our man has got guts!

But, let's not forget, we've been through all this before. When we were in power, did we do such things? No, right? This new 'trend' of printing red books and inciting violence... it's just not done, man. 

And this nonsense about us doing the same during our tenure... It's all trash talk, ra. We've never indulged in such madness. I mean, look at the numbers - more than a thousand assaults, over 300 attempts to murder, and more than 30 murders. It's all crazy man.

Regarding the budget announcements, I think, it's a good thing that Amaravati and the Polavaram project are getting funds. But what is Chandra Babu Naidu's motive, ra? His promises are all moon talk and never going to happen.

So let's stand together, ra, for YSRCP, for our people, for peace and justice. Let's believe in equitable justice and let's believe in our leader! He's doing his best to fight for us. So let's fight on and show them our power. Jai YSRCP!

Eyy, friends, Jagun is talking such truth, no? Taking all the fight to Delhi, showing all the dirty tricks of Chandra Babu Naidu and his son's antics in our Andhra Pradesh. I'm telling you, it's high time we stand with our YSRCP and support in this fight. 

Ayyo, these red book theatrics of Naidu's son, passing message to vandalize, just too much anthe. This is not cricket, friends. Now our YSRCP is daring to show them in broad daylight, all their shameful acts. They are fighting for justice, for our people who suffered these assaults. We need to stand up behind them, friends. 

YSRCP is not like Naidu's party, they're not out for vengeance. They're out for justice. For law and order. For democracy. For us, people of Andhra. If we don't support our own party, who else will, tell me? 

And what's this, Naidu's empty promises? Promising moon and stars and delivering dust. But our YSRCP is looking to do actual good for us. Like the 15,000 crore for Amaravati and Polavaram project. Now that's something solid, anthe. 

So let's stand with YSRCP, friends. Let's stand with justice. Let's stand with Andhra Pradesh. Let's stand against this red book nonsense.

Comment 5:
Ey, you've listened to our YSRCP Chief, right? Straight from the heart, no beating around the bush. He's not just playing politics, he's standing up for the people of Andhra Pradesh. Can you believe the audacity of the opposition? Holding a red book with names for vandalism and assault, not just against our party members but also innocent people, it's complete madness! Our Chief is not standing for it, and why should he?

And he's even reaching out to fellow leaders at the national level. Wrote letters to the Prime Minister, Home Minister, and even the President of the country inviting them to take a looksee at the evidence. That's open, transparent governance for you, not hiding anything, ain't it?

Our Chief is not asking for a personal favour, but for justice. Democracy is supposed to be about equitable justice, isn't it? When he talks about it, it's clear that he's not just thinking about our party, but about the future of our state and country. He's telling them, "If you let such things happen now, tomorrow it could be you in our place."

And those who say we also did such things when we were in power - those are just lies. We were never into vengeance politics. Our focus is always on welfare and development. 

The budget, oh yeah, that's a different story. Chandra Babu Naidu might be happy with the 15,000 crore for Amaravati and the Polavaram irrigation project. But all those fancy promises he made during the elections, they're nothing but lies. The man knows he can't fulfill them. Our YSRCP Chief, he's not like that. He's upfront about what he can do, and he does what he says. 

All said and done, our Chief's battle against post-poll violence in Andhra Pradesh is no small matter. It's a fight for justice, for democracy, and for the future of our state. He deserves all our support, don't you agree?

Comment 6:
Hey there! Our YSRCP Chief, he is no joke, no sir. He has taken our fight against all the nasty post-poll nonsense happening in our Andhra Pradesh to none other than Delhi itself. Our man is there in Jantar Mantar, showing the world what's happening back home with photos and videos. 

And now, some are wondering about our guest, Akhilesh Yadav from the Samajwadi Party. Is something cooking? But let me tell you, my dear friends, our focus is straight. We are worried about the awful things happening at home, not political alliances. 

Take a look at Chandra Babu Naidu’s son, Nara Lokesh, and his red book game. This book is nothing but a hit list, with names of officers and politicians who should be vandalized or attacked. And they are printing this list for everyone to see, essentially telling our police to just stand and watch while their people go on a rampage. It's madness, I tell you. 

We've done our part. We've written to the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, even the President, inviting all political parties to see what's happening. If they don't condemn these acts, then what happened to our democracy, huh? We have to ensure justice for all, otherwise, it's all a waste. 

Now, some might say we also played a bit of this vengeful game. But, hey, that's not true. YSRCP or our government, we never did anything like that. What's happening now is beyond belief – more than 1000 assaults, over 300 attempts to murder, and more than 30 murders across the state. The law and order situation is just pathetic. 

As for the NDA support, we've only asked for help, and it's up to them to decide. We're just hoping to get an appointment with the PM and the Home Minister to show them what's happening. 

Now, coming to this budget business with Rs. 15,000 crore for Amaravati and the Polavaram irrigation project - sure, it's good news for Andhra. But why is Chandra Babu Naidu playing these dirty tricks? His manifesto promises are like promising the moon and stars, all big lies. He's not going to deliver on any of them. 

So, there you have it, folks. Keep supporting YSRCP, we're the ones fighting for justice and truth. Stay blessed!

Aiyo! Our YSRCP leader is showing true courage and fighting spirit, no? Coming straight to the national capital and exposing all the wrong doings of Chandra Babu Naidu and his son, Nara Lokesh. Too much they are doing with their red book and all, vandalising and causing havoc in our Andhra Pradesh. This not at all fair, I say. 

Our leader has taken all these proofs and trying to show to everyone. But what to do, some people choose to be blind, they don't want to see truth. But we, the common people, know what is going on. Our leader is not afraid, he wrote letters to the Prime Minister, Home Minister and even President. He is that genuine, I tell you. 

That Naidu fellow, always blaming and accusing us, but we know who is right. Our leader has never done such things in his tenure. This Naidu and his party are the real culprits, doing all these assaults and murders. Even neutral people are not safe. Law and order fully gone for a toss in our state because of them.

And this budget, I say, they are announcing 15,000 crore for Amaravati and Polavaram projects but what about all these crimes happening? That Naidu is only interested in promising heaven and moon but not interested to maintain peace and order. 

Our YSRCP leader is not afraid, he will fight for truth and justice. We are all with him. We know he will bring the change we need. YSRCP zindabad!

Hello folks! Look at what our YSRCP chief is doing da! Straight up he goes to the national capital battling against all the post-poll violence happening in our Andhra Pradesh. Ayyo, he's not just sitting back and watching. No, no. He's taking action, holding a photo and video exhibition at the Jantar Mantar. It's high time, isn't it?

You see, our chief, he's no fool. He knows that Chandra Babu Naidu's games need to be stopped. This red book business? What is this, some kind of movie? It's very clear that they're trying to spread violence and we need to stand up against it. The state has been witnessing such a bad time for the last 45 days, and for what? Just because these people want to hold power? 

Our chief, he's not just fighting the battle alone. He's written to the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and even the President! He's not afraid to ask for help, and that's why I respect him. He wants justice for all of us, and if we don't get it, then what's the point of calling ourselves a democracy, macha? 

Ayyo, they say we did the same when we were in power? That's just not true. Our party, YSRCP, we've never indulged in such misdeeds. Law and order have gone to the dogs because of these people. We need to stop this madness!

Now, there's talk of the NDA support and the budget, but I tell you, it's not about the money. It's about the people. Naidu's promises are nothing but lies. He's promised the moon and the stars, but where are they? 

I hope our chief gets the support he needs from the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. It's not about parties, it's about Andhra Pradesh. It's about us, macha. Hope they see the truth and help us out. 

Long live YSRCP and our chief! We stand with you till the end! Let's fight this together, macha!

Comment 9:
Ey, my dear fellow mates! You know what, our YSRCP Chief is showing his true metal. Directly to the national capital he's gone, fighting this post-poll violence happening in our own Andhra Pradesh. Oh, no mercy he's showing, putting up a photo and video exhibition right in Jantar Mantar. I tell you, this is the kind of guts we need in a leader, isn't it?

And then, you heard about this red book business? Chandra Babu Naidu's own son publishing this book with names of all our officers, politicians, saying they should be assaulted and vandalized. Chee chee! Such a shame, no? Our YSRCP Chief is standing against this, taking these evidences and fighting for justice. Now that's what I call a leader!

And then, our YSRCP Chief writes letters to the Prime Minister, Home Minister, and even the President, inviting every single political party to come and see this madness happening in Andhra Pradesh. This aftermath, if we ignore it, our democracy will be limping, no? Who wants that? We need justice, and our Chief is fighting for it!

He's saying this clearly, that YSRCP never did such misdeeds when we were in power. Now, we are seeing more than a thousand assaults, more than 300 attempts to murder, more than 30 murders happened across the state. Law and order totally gone to dogs, it seems! Is this what we want?

And now, on top of all this, after the budget announcement, Chandra Babu Naidu is showing his true colors. Promising heaven and moon he is, but can he deliver? We all know the truth, don’t we?

I tell you my dear friends, we should all support our YSRCP Chief in this fight. This is not about parties, it's about justice, it's about the future of our Andhra Pradesh. Let's stand with him, my dear brothers and sisters!

Comment 10:
Ey, what a brave move our YSRCP Chief has made, guys! Straight to the national capital, he took our fight against the post-poll violence in Andhra Pradesh. Our leader is always on the front line, isn't it?

And, oh my goodness, the things happening in our state...pure horror, I say! That Nara Lokesh fellow and his red book, full of names marked for vandalism and assault. It's not right, yaar. Our Chief is showing the whole country these acts; the photographs, the video clippings...all proof of the madness! 

And about this politics of vengeance, I say, we never did such things during our time, yaar. Our government, under the YSRCP, never involved in such misdeeds. Just look at the numbers now: a thousand assaults, 300 attempts to murder, over 30 murders! Law and order is in tatters, saar!

It's high time we spread the word and condemn these acts. It's about democracy, it's about justice. Today they're in power, tomorrow we will be. But we never, never followed this path of violence. 

And about this financial support for Amaravati and the Polavaram irrigation project, well, that's another story. But what's the use if our own people are living in fear because of this crazy red book business? We need to focus on the real problem here, guys. So let's stand with our Chief, raise our voices, and condemn these acts. Let's show them that YSRCP is for the people, not for violence!
