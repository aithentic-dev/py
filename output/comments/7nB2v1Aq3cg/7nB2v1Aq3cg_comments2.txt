"YSRCP Party is always working for justice and peace in our Andhra Pradesh, no? Chief is taking big steps to stop this violence, and even showing the truth to all in Delhi. We must condemn these acts, friends, our state's reputation is at stake. Surely, the central government will see our troubles. Let's hope for the best."

YSRCP party is doing correct work, focusing on real problem, making sure justice is delivered. Our leader is not silent, he's bringing these harsh acts in front of everyone. Reaching out to all parties, showing violence evidence, asking for justice. He's not playing politics, he's standing for truth. Today they do this, tomorrow we come to power, we should not repeat, right? For that we must condemn today. YSRCP never participated in such bad acts, we always stood for justice, we'll stand for justice. We are putting faith in PM and Home Minister, hoping they'll hear us. This fight is not about parties, it's about justice. Let's stand together.

Our YSRCP Chief is truly fighting for justice. He's showing the harsh reality of Andhra Pradesh to the nation. His efforts to expose the wrongs done by Chandra Babu Naidu and his son are commendable. We need more leaders like him to bring about change. We trust in his leadership and believe he will continue to fight for justice, despite the challenges.

Our YSRCP Chief is truly fighting for justice in our Andhra Pradesh. He is standing strong against the wrongs and taking them to the top. Not just a political game, but for real justice. We need more leaders like him. But these budget announcements, let's see how they help our state. Babu sir's promises always sound big, but let's see if they become reality or not. Let's stand with YSRCP for a better Andhra Pradesh, friends!

YSRCP is doing good work, no? Fighting for justice and peace in Andhra Pradesh. We need this kind of strong leadership. They are not afraid to tell truth to power. And they are getting support also, it seems. I'm hoping they'll continue to do good work for the people. Long live YSRCP!

Our YSRCP Chief is a fighting spirit, no? Taking all this violence straight to Delhi, it's a good job he's doing. And this red book business, it's not a fair play at all. Our party never went for such things, we believe in justice, not vandalism. We need to condemn these acts for our democracy's sake, that's for sure. This is not about parties, it's about justice, and our Chief is doing his best to ensure that, isn't it?

Let's keep shining light on these matters, ensuring a safer Andhra Pradesh for all. The budget announcements too, are promising for our state's progress. Even in the face of opposition's empty promises, YSRCP stays dedicated to real work!

Our YSRCP chief indeed standing firm, no? Straight to national capital with the fight, that’s the spirit we need. See, he’s not forgetting our cause. Fighting for justice in Andhra, holding exhibitions to show the truth- that's the real leadership. He's not about petty politics, he's about people. Ayyo, these red book incidents, assault and all, it's just not right. More power to YSRCP to bring the truth out. Good they are not silent. And this false blaming, saying YSRCP did same thing, it's not true. We never indulge in such activities. And about the budget, let's see what happens. But one thing is clear, YSRCP is standing firm. That's what matters.
