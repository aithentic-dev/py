against the post pole violence in Andra  Pradesh straight to the national capital  today he is in jant Manar holding photo  and video exhibition uh jagun RI G thank  you so much for speaking totv I'll begin  by asking you that you had an unusual  guest sometime back in uh akilesh yadav  samajwadi party Chief is there some  signal of a political  realignment  my most important aspect here is let's  not deviate the issue see the topic here  is there have been ghastly  incidents which have taken place in the  state of Andra  Pradesh which are to be what ought to be  condemned in a civil  society you know these kind of  Acts where Chandra Babu NAU's own son  Nara  loes  actually  actually comes up with  a red book like  this and makes Holdings of these red  books and this photograph is made a  holding and printed all over the state  and literally passes a  message  that we are going to go ahead vandalize  that red book has names of all the  officers names of all the  politicians on whom vandalism should  take place assault should take place and  this poster this these Holdings are  published all over the state giving a  message to the police that our people  are going on a rampage you people are  supposed to just watch a rather fer  false cases on victims rather than the  people who assault that kind of a  message with that kind of a message last  45 days in the state is  seen these kind of assaults which have  never taken place in fact all these uh  posters that you see are material  evidence  and all this on these video clippings  are all material evidence where you have  people literally hacking a person to  death you had written a letter to the  Prime Minister that there is some kind  of evil design to suppress ysrcp what  has been the response to that in  fact I had written letters to the Prime  Minister I had written letters to the  home minister I had also written letters  to the president of the country as well  in fact we have invited every political  party irrespective of which Forum they  belong to asking them to come over and  see for themselves these photographs  that are displayed the video clippings  that are being played and make up for  themselves make make their mind for  themselves whether this is to be  condemned or not because if these acts  are not  condemned democracy would limp see Dem  what is democracy Equitable Justice if  Equitable Justice is not imparted  what  happens this is what you're seeing in in  the state of Andra Pradesh and this is  not condemned then tomorrow they are in  power tomorrow tomorrow we will come to  power yesterday we were in power but we  never did this something like this today  they are in power they're setting up a  new trend printing red books writing  down names making Holdings of them I  mean publicizing them as hings and then  going ahead with this  vandalism this kind of things these acts  are not condemned then do you think  democracy would Prevail one may say that  this politics of Vengeance which is  playing out was also something that we  saw during your tenure when there was  vindictive action as Mr Naidu said  against him and he was sent to  jail never ysrcp or our government  indulged in these kind of misdeeds you  know this is absurd this is madness  you're talking about more than thousand  assaults you're talking about more than  300 attempt to Deaths you're talking  about across the state more than 30 30  murders which have which have taken  place across be it in every category be  it be it from kakas to sympathizers to  even neutral people because Law and  Order is Law and Order has is  deteriorated and Mr ready right now you  have another guest here and again an  India partner how should that be  seen you had written as you said to all  political parties but you getting  support from from India  Block in  fact we can only request I can only  request Maria to see for herself and  protest irrespective of which party it  comes from have you got an appointment  with the Prime Minister and the home  minister to communicate your concerns is  to be condemned I can at best ask them  that's what I did I humbly asked them  and I'm hoping that they would give an  appointment and they would also condemn  these kind of things that is a I can do  this is got no there there no parties  involved here okay today is an  interesting day because this is coming a  day after the budget where 15,000 CR has  been announced for uh uh financial  support for amravati and also the Pam  irrigation project uh how are you  looking at these announcements in the  budget  what what those announcements would give  to the state of Andra Pradesh or  something else but why Chandra Babu NAU  is doing these kind of things is  something else Chandra Babu NAU is doing  these kind of things because his  Manifesto  promises are heaven and moon which have  been promised knowing very well that  they are lies yet he had  promised and those kind of promises are  not going to be met with",2.32,English (auto-generated)
